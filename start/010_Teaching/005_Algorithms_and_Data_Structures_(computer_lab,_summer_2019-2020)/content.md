A new set of exercises will be made available every week. Each 
exercise can be implemented in your language of choice with some caveats.
Please don't use languages that rely strongly on functional programming
(e.g. haskell, lisp) because your solutions might diverge from the 
lectured material. The aim of the exercises is to implement the algorithms from
schratch so please don't use existing libraries. At the end of the semester you will be graded based
on the number of exercises that were solved (the grading curve will be
determined at the end of the semester). 

Solutions to exercises can be sent to <kacper.topolnicki@uj.edu.pl> from
your university e-mail address. The
topic of the message must contain the phrase "hornswogglingRabidRabbit" and the attachment 
should have a `.zip` file with Your program. The `.zip` archive should unpack to a single directory
with a bash script `run` that does all the work. In case any of You want to try some funny business - 
all programs will be ran inside a virtual machine
with Ubuntu :-)

There will additionally be a test (related to concepts from the lecture)
and a final project. You need a positive grade from the exercises, the test,
and the project to get a positive final grade. The final grade will be a weighted
average:

* number of exercises (60%)
* test (20%)
* final project (20%)
