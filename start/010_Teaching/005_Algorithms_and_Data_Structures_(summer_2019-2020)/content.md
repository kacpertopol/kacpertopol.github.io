A new set of exercises will be made available every week. Each 
exercise can be implemented in your language of choice - with one caveat.
Please don't use languages that rely strongly on functional programming
(haskell, lisp) because your solutions might diverge from the 
lectured material. At the end of the semester you will be graded based
on the number of exercises that were solved (the grading curve will be
determined at the end of the semester). 

There will additionally be a test (related to concepts from the lecture)
and a final project. You need a positive grade from the exercises, the test,
and the project to get a positive final grade. The final grade will be a weighted
average:

* number of exercises (60%)
* test (20%)
* final project (20%)
