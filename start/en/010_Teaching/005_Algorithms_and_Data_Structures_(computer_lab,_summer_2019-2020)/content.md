A new set of exercises will be made available, on average, every week. Each 
exercise can be implemented in your language of choice (preferably
c, c++ ,fortran, java, python), with some caveats:

* Please don't use languages that rely strongly on functional programming
  (e.g. haskell, lisp) because your solutions might diverge from the 
  lectured material. 
* The aim of the exercises is to implement the algorithms from
  scratch so please don't use existing libraries. 

At the end of the semester you will be graded based
on the number of exercises that were solved (the grading curve will be
determined at the end of the semester). Submitting solutions:

* Solutions to exercises must be sent to <kacper.topolnicki@uj.edu.pl> from
  your university (!) e-mail address. 
* The title of the message must contain the word "AISD220192020"
  surrounded by white spaces, the set number, and exercise number.
* The attachment  should have a `.zip` file with your program. 
  * The `.zip` archive should unpack to a single directory
    with a bash script `run` that does all the work.  

All programs will be ran inside a virtual machine with Ubuntu 
in case any of you want to try some funny business :-)

There will additionally be a test (related to concepts from the lecture)
and a final project. You need a positive grade from the exercises, the test,
and the project to get a positive final grade. The final grade will be a weighted
average:

* number of exercises (60%)
* test (20%)
* final project (20%)
