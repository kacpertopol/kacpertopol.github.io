Students will get a chance to obtain basic skills and information related to working in 
Linux / UNIX operating systems and programming in the Wolfram Language, with 
emphasis on data visualization and numerical calculations.

The workshop language is English and will cover the following topics:

- basics of Linux / UNIX 
- basics of Wolfram Language (WL) programming
- writing WL packages and scripts
- the structure of graphics in the WL with emphasis on data visualization
- multi core calculations using the WL
- compilation of WL expressions in order to speed up computations
- integration of the WL with c
- basics of MPI and OPENMP in C, integratino with the WL

Grading will be based on the final projects. The last workshop 
will be devoted to project presentations.
