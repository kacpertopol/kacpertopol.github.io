# Organization

Students will get a chance to obtain basic skills and information related to working in 
Linux / UNIX operating systems and programming in the Wolfram Language, with 
emphasis on data visualization and numerical calculations.

The workshop language is English and will cover the following topics:

- basics of Linux / UNIX 
- basics of Wolfram Language (WL) programming
- writing WL packages and scripts
- the structure of graphics in the WL with emphasis on data visualization
- multi core calculations using the WL
- compilation of WL expressions in order to speed up computations
- integration of the WL with c
- basics of MPI and OPENMP in C, integratino with the WL

Grading will be based on the final projects. The last workshop 
will be devoted to project presentations.


# Getting Mathematica

Instructions for obtaining *Mathematica* by *Jagiellonian University* students 
can be found [here](https://fais.uj.edu.pl/documents/41628/5097967/OprogramowanieMathematica_na_Uniwersytecie_Jagiello%C5%84skim_2018.pdf/eca91225-a7c0-48fb-94a9-a08553de7fd7).
Unfortunetly these instructions are available only in Polish. I will translate the necessary steps into English soon and post them here.

TODO: translate instructions
