**WORKSHOPS**
</center>

Most classes will take place at the university, however some
workshops will be organized via *MS Teams*. Please monitor 
communications from the university and university web pages.

<center>
**MATHEMATICA**
</center>

During class we will be working with the *Mathematica* programm.
Please familiarize yourselves with the 
[instructions](https://fais.uj.edu.pl/documents/41628/5097967/OprogramowanieMathematica_na_Uniwersytecie_Jagiello%C5%84skim_2018.pdf/eca91225-a7c0-48fb-94a9-a08553de7fd7) 
available at:
<https://fais.uj.edu.pl/dla-studentow/studia-z-mathematica>
before the first workshop.
A license can be obtained and *Mathematica*
can be installed on your personal computers.
During class you can use your own laptops (at your own risk)
or the computers in the computer lab.

**Uwaga**: when applying for a *Mathematica* license
use your official university e-mail. This is used to 
verify that you are indeed a student of the university
and can be granted a license.
Information about activating student e-mail can be found at:
<https://pomocit.uj.edu.pl/poczta_studenci>.

**GRADING**
</center>

- The final grade will have three components:
	- grade from the final project (50%),
	- grade from points obtained for completing exercises (25%),
	- grade from a test/exam comprising basic information covered during the course  (25%).
- A lot of emphasis is on individual work, at least two, three hours a week. 
- Points from exercises can be obtained during every class,
  Simply demonstrate your program and briefly describe how it works.
- Exercises from a given day can be submitted anytime but ...
  - ... if there is no time to check the exercises at the end
  of the semester you will lose the possibility to obtain points from your solution. 
	**For this reason: please try to submit exercises as early as possible**
