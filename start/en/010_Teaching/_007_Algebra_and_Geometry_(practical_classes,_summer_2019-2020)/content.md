The final grade from the exercise session will be based on 
three graded tests and the number of completed exercises
(the grading curve will be determined at the end of the semester).
Each completed exercise must be declared. Careful: If a student
can not solve a declared exercise at the board all previously 
declared exercises will be canceled. Additionally this student
must provide a written solution for all declared exercises.
This is plenty of work both for the student and the teacher
so such shenanigans are highly discouraged :-)

The final grade will be a weighted average:

* 20% I test
* 20% II test
* 20% III test
* 40% number of declared exercises

However, in order to get a positive grade, the student must have a positive
grade from all of the tests and number of exercises.
