Follow the instructions on the [*SciPy* webpage](https://www.scipy.org/)
and install the *SciPy* python ecosystem.

Download the [basic script](./start/en/010_Teaching/010_Exercise_sets_(Kacper_Topolnicki)/001_Set_1_(25_I_2020)/basic_example.py).
Run this script using one of the two following methods:

- navigate to the script directory in the terminal (command line) and run `python basic_example.py`
- (this method will probably not work on Windows) navigate to the script directory, permit the script to be executed using `chmod +x basic_example.py` and run `./basic_example.py`

You can also try and use `ipython` to execute commands from this script one by one.

Download the [more complicated example](./start/en/010_Teaching/010_Exercise_sets_(Kacper_Topolnicki)/001_Set_1_(25_I_2020)/more_complex_example.zip).
Unpack this directory, carefully read the *README.pdf* file and try running the *compress.py*
script.

This example does not have much to do with statistics but it demonstrates the 
powerful capabilities of the `numpy` library. Please rewrite this script without
using `numpy` and compare execution times of both implementations.

Plot the function $f(x) = \left(\sin{x^{2}}\right)^{2}$ for $0 < x < \sqrt{2 \pi}$ and calculate the integral
$\int_{0}^{\sqrt{2 \pi}} f(x) dx$ using *SciPy*.
