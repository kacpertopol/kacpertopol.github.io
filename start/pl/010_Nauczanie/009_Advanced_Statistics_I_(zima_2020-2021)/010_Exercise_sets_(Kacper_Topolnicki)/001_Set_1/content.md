Download the [basic script](---ThisDir---/basic_example.py).
Run this script using one of the two following methods:

- navigate to the script directory in the terminal (command line) and run `python basic_example.py`
- (this method will probably not work on Windows) navigate to the script directory, permit the script to be executed using `chmod +x basic_example.py` and run `./basic_example.py`

You can also try and use `ipython` to execute commands from this script one by one.

Download the [more complicated example](---ThisDir---/more_complex_example.zip).
Unpack this directory, carefully read the *README.pdf* file and try running the *compress.py*
script.

This example does not have much to do with statistics but it demonstrates the 
powerful capabilities of the `numpy` library. Please rewrite this script without
using `numpy` and compare execution times of both implementations.
