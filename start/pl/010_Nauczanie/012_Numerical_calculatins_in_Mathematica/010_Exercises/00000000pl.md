  - CAREFULL: the sceleton for the function solving the hanoi tower is wrong!

- [please read this notebook](./start/pl/010_Nauczanie/012_Numerical_calculatins_in_Mathematica/010_Exercises/002_Set_2/hanoi.nb)
  - detailed information about the Hanoi Tower puzzle
- exercises **A**-**C** are marked as additional exercises
  - points from these exercises will not be used when determing 
    the grading curve
  - nontheless I encourage you to try and solve them

**A (additional challenge)**

Mathematica is an very flexible language and can be used to prototype
different styles of programming. Introduction of types can lead to 
a style that mimics object oriented programming. 
More interesting, at least in my opinion, is the possibility to 
program in a functional style.

We have seen how to 
implement the *hsif* (inverse *fish*) operator for the
Hanoi tower in order to keep track of the history without
having to resort to dirty tricks such as side effects.

Please implement new *bind* and *hsif* functions such that, for example if:
```
possibilitiesAfter[x_] := {x + 1 , x - 1};
otherPossibilitiesAfter[x] := {x + I , x - I};
```
then
```
(otherPossibilitiesAfter ~ hsif	~ possibilitiesAfter)[1]
```
results in (some ordering of):
```
{2 + I , 2 - I , 1 + I , 1 - I}
```

In other words this new *bind* and *hsif* allows us to compose functions that 
return alternative possibilities (for example of things happening).

<center>
**B (additional challenge)**
</center>

<center>
(2 punkt)
</center>

A nice feature of the functional approach is that we can use equational reasoning 
about our programm. Please check if the [monad laws](https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad_laws)
are satisfied in **A**. 

Tip: `>==` is `bind`.

<center>
**C (additional challenge)**
</center>

<center>
(3 punkt)
</center>

Similar to **A** but this time *bind* and *hsif* allow us to compose
functions that can return an error. 

Tip: have a look at [the maybe monad](https://wiki.haskell.org/Maybe).

<center>
**D**
</center>

Create an animation of the solution to the Hanoi tower. 
First try to implement a function that draws a
single state of the puzzle. Next try `Manipulate` or `ListAnimate`.

Try to export this solution as a `GIF`.

Tip: Use the built in language for graphics.

Turn your implementation of the Mandelbrot set from the **Set 1**
into a compiled function. Using `AbsoluteTiming` compare the speed
of the implementation with different `CompilationTarget` and `Parallelization`.

<center>
**E**
</center>

<center>
(2 punkt)
</center>

Implement the calculation of the Mandelbrot set using
a more traditional compiled language, `C` or `FORTRAN`.
Try to use the same algorithm. Compare the speed
to the compiled functions in `Mathematica`.




# Set 4

- [please read this notebook](./start/pl/010_Nauczanie/012_Numerical_calculatins_in_Mathematica/010_Exercises/004_Set_4/schoedinger.nb)
  - please run *Evaluate Notebook* before reading
  - this is not the end of the story, we will be 
    covering other visualization techniques

<center>
**A**
</center>

<center>
(4 punkt)
</center>

Chose a file with data related to your own work
or something you are currently interested in. 
Implement functions that create `Graphics[...]`
or `Graphics3D[...]` expressions ment to visualize this data.
The point is not to use the built in `Plot`, `ListPlot`,
etc. but create your own implementation from the ground up
... this is a bit of work hence the 4 points :) 

<center>
**B**
</center>

<center>
(2 punkt)
</center>

Using your implmementation from **A**, write 
a *Wolfram Languate* script with a simple 
Command Line Interface (CLI). In a minimal CLI
(you are encouraged to extend this):

- the path of the data files that are to be 
  visualized are passed as positional arguments
- `--help` and `-h` print information to the standard output
  about what the script does and what arguments it can take
- `--verbose` and '-v' produce ... verbose output from the script
  this is usefull for debugging purpouses

Tip: you can use `$ScriptCommandLine` in conjunction with
pattern matching in `Cases` to parse the command line arguments.

The notebook in the **Additional Materials** contains a
function that soves a certain popular equation in Physics
using `Compile`. Rewrite this function one of the following:

- `c`
- `c++`
- `python` with `numpy` or `pytorch`
- `Fortran`

or some other programming language that compiles to native code. 

Use this implementation with in a program with
a clean, readable CLI.

PS If you like you can also chose some other equation to solve numerically.
Additionally, if you chose to implmement the function from the **Additional Materials**
you can use a simpler integration method - we will be more interested in programming
techniques then precission.

**B**
</center>

<center>
(3 punkt)
</center>

Change the implementation in `sch.c` (alternatively you can use some other programm)
to write the result to standard output (is this better, faster?). Change the notebook from the **Additional Materials**
to read and parse the result from standard output.

<center>
**C**
</center>

<center>
(4 punkt)
</center>

The notebook from the **Additional Materials** runs a single process with `sch`. Please
modify the code to run `sch` in parallel for different specifications of the potential. 
Wrap everything up in a single function.

Tip: Have a look at `StartProcess`.

  - please read the notebook
  - some changes

	- changed the plot from `Image3D` to `ListContourPlot3D` - looks prettier
  - **WARNING** 
    - please **DO NOT** run *Evaluate Notebook* before reading
	- I'm getting a strange Mathematica bug when running this notebook
	- there might be some memory leaks or buffer overflows in to the x window system / graphics card
	- mathematica is working so hard on calculating the eigenvalues that the screen goes black ...
	- **RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK**
