It's $3$ o'clock in the morning and you need to prepare some formula to feed your newborn baby. The instructions on the package are
very specific: prepare a certain amount of water at a given temperature, add the correct amount of formula, mix 
and cool everything down before serving. In order to keep the baby safe from infections, 
all the water that you use needs to be pre-boiled. Here is your setup:

1. You prepared a container of pre-boiled water
   cooled down to the temperature $T_{\text{cool}}$. 
2. You prepared an empty, sterile feeding bottle.
3. You have an electric kettle and measured that when the water comes out of the spout it has temperature
   $T_{\text{hot}}$ (it's slightly cooler then $100^{\circ}C$).
4. You need to prepare $V$ milliliters (or any other unit of volume) water at temperature $T$ to mix
   up the formula for your little one. You do this by first pouring $V_{\text{cool}}$ milliliters (or any other unit of volume)
   of the cooler water into the bottle and then filling the bottle up to $V$ with the hot water from the kettle. How much cool water 
   should you use?

The mathematics of this problem is very simple, see the **APPENDIX**.
To make things more convenient implement the python function:
```python
def calculateVcool(Tcool , Thot , V , T):
    #...
    return Vcool
```
that returns the volume of the cooler water $V_{\text{cool}}$ you need to pour into the bottle before pouring the remainder
of the water
from the kettle. This volume is calculated in such a way that when mixed the water has temperature $T$. 

Tip: If you find yourself in this scenario a infrared thermometer is a fantastic tool.

Turn the ``V``, ``T``, and ``Thot`` arguments of function ``calculateVcool`` from exercise **A** into 
optional arguments with realistic default values for a $3$
month old baby. 

<center>
**C**
</center>

<center>

Write a python script that asks the user to input the arguments of ``calculateVcool`` from **A**,
runs the function and prints the result.

Nobody has time to fiddle around with their laptop at $3$ o'clock in the morning. Get the script from **C**
to run on your phone (at your own risk :-) ).

Your significant other (SO) has the early morning shift with the baby and asked you to prepare a thermos
with pre-boiled water. You have determined the temperature coefficient of the thermos (the mathematics
of this is very simple, see the **APPENDIX**) and need to decide on the temperature of the water 
in the thermos so that in a couple of hours, when your SO needs to prepare the formula, the temperature
of the water in the thermos is appropriate.

To help with this implement the python function:
```python
def calculateTemperature(Tfinal , time , Troom , k , 
        search = (0.0 , 100.0 , 1000)):
    #...
    return T
```    
where ``Tfinal`` is the desired temperature of the water after time ``time``, ``Troom`` is the 
ambient room temperature and ``k`` is the temperature coefficient. The final optional argument 
``search`` determines the parameters
of a numerical simulation that will solve the problem.
The returned value ``T`` is the desired temperature
of water in the thermos.

Use a simple numerical simulation to solve the problem.
In this simulation scan initial water temperature 
candidates in the range ``search[0]`` $\ldots$ 
``search[1]``. The range is divided into ``search[2]`` temperature values. 
For each temperature candidate, the final temperature after time ``time``
is calculated (see **APPENDIX**). Finally, out of all the temperature
candidates, the one whose final temperature is closest to the desired ``Tfinal``
is returned as ``T``. In your implementation please use:

- a list comprehension,
- tuple unpacking,
- the functions \verb|min| and \verb|index|.

Tip: The exponent is available in the ``math`` library. There is no need to install anything, it comes 
built in. Simply use ``from math import exp``

<center>
**APPENDIX**
</center>

When mixing water to arrive at a given temperature, approximately (the notation is the same as in the exercises):
$$
	V_{\text{cool}} = V \frac{T_{\text{hot}} - T}{T_{\text{hot}} - T_{\text{cool}}}
$$
Does it matter if we use $^{\circ}C$ or $^{\circ}K$? Is the formula any different if you prefer to pour the
hot water first?

When water in a container is left in a room with ambient temperature $T_{\text{room}}$ it will gradually, 
over time change it's temperature to match the ambient temperature. This process can be approximately modeled
by the formula:
$$
	\tau(t) = T_{\text{room}} - (T_{\text{room}} - \tau(0)) e^{-t/k}
$$
where $\tau(0)$ is the initial temperature of water in the thermos and $\tau(t)$ is the temperature in the 
thermos after time $t$. The remaining notation is the same as in the exercises. Please note that 
a non-standard definition of the temperature coefficient $k$ is used. The value of this coefficient
can be worked out by measuring the temperature of the water in the thermos at two points in time 
and doing a little algebra.
Does it matter if we use $^{\circ}C$ or $^{\circ}K$? Is the formula any different if you prefer to pour the
hot water first?

*...to is or not to is, dictionaries, loops, flow control, modules and objects...*
</center>

<center>
**A**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Implement a function that takes an arbitrary number of arguments,
say floating point numbers,
and returns a dictionary containing:

- a list containing all the arguments
- the mean of the arguments
- the standard deviation of the arguments

Use this function in a script.

<center>
**B**
</center>

<center>

</center>

Implement a simple [text based game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game). The gameplay
and objective is completely up to you. 

Please base your implementation on the following function:
```python
def updateGameState(state)
    # ...
```
that updates the dictionary `state` in every iteration of the
main game loop:
```python
while(!state["finished"]):
    # ...    
```

At each iteration of the game loop print
the available moves / options available to the player and use the `input`
function to decide on how to proceed with the game play. Use `if`, `else`, and `elif`
statements to decide how the game `state` will evolve. When the game is finished, change
the value of `"finished"` in `state` to `True`. This will cause the main loop of the
game to terminate.

<center>
**C**
</center>

<center>
(3 points)
</center>

Add some elegant [ASCI art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) to your game.
To do this please import the `sys` module and use the `sys.stdout.write` method
to implement the function:
```python
def showGameState(state):
    # ...
```
that will print a beautiful graphical representation of the game state to "standard output".
Add this function to the main game loop.
Please assume that we are working in a terminal that is $80$ characters wide and $40$ characters tall.

Tips:

- use two nested `for` loops to sweep over all the $80 \times 40$ "pixel" display we use in the game
- use `if` and / or a dictionary to decide what character to put in each "pixel"
- the new line character is `\n`
- this does not have to be very complicated, drawing a map with the location of the player is great but 
  printing some basic information about the game statistics is 
  also fine

<center>
**D**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Implement a "smart" function:
```python
def smartFunction(a , b):
    # ...
    return c
```
that returns the result `c = a + b`. Since this
operation is very laborious and time consuming, the function memorizes previous arguments
`a`, `b` that were passed to it, it also memorizes the result. This is all in the hope that when 
we pass those arguments to the function again it won't have to do all that work, it'll 
just recall the result.

In order to achieve this introduce a global variable `smartFunctionMemory` that will contain a dictionary.
The keys in this dictionary are related to the arguments `a`, `b`, and the values are related to the
results `c`.

What types of arguments can we pass into `smartFunction`?

<center>
**E**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Implement the function:
```python
def readState(path)
    # ...
    return state
```
that reads the state from a file located at path `path`. The contents of this file
is processed to obtain the saved state of a previous game. 

Implement the function:
```python
def writeState(state , path)
    # ...
```
that writes the game state to a file located at path `path`.

Add `readState` before the start of the game loop and `writeState` after the loop to allow the user
to save the game progress.

Tip: Don't worry we'll discuss the details during class :-)

</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Replace the repeated `if`, `elif`, `else` statements from your game in **Set 2** with `match`.
If these statements don't appear in the game, please add some.

<center>
**B**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

End your scripts from **Set 1** with an infinite `while` loop instead of a call similar to `input("Hit enter to exit.")`.
Please use `pass` in the infinite loop. 

Import the `time` module and use the `time.time()` function to measure the time the program spends in the loop.
If this time exceeds $10$ seconds, ask the user if the program should exit. If the program is supposed to wait
reset the timer and run the loop for another $10$ seconds.

Tip: use `continue`, and `break`.

<center>
**C**
</center>

<center>
(4 points)
</center>

Using the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) please investigate the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map).

Create a function that calculates the logistic map and draw the map using the `matplotlib` library, we will discuss how this library works during class. 
Make sure the notebook
has a detailed description of your approach, use [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

<center>
**D**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Re-implement the function from **C** to accept a keyword argument `drawFunction`. If the value of this keyword
argument is not the default `None` then `drawFunction` points to a function that draws the data and a plot of the 
logistic map is produced automatically.

Test if this works using a `lambda` expression.

Can you use `is` to check if `drawFunction` has the default value?

Implement a [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) calculator. 
Base your program on a stack implemented as a python `list`. All operations of the calculator 
take the stack, modify it and return the modified stack. For example adding two numbers:

```python
def add(stack):
    x = stack.pop()      # 1
    y = stack.pop()      # 2
    stack.append(x + y)  # 3
    return stack         # 4
```

At **1** a number is popped from the end of the list with `pop` resulting in a shorter stack. 
At **2** another number is popped from the stack. Finally in **3** the stack is modified by adding
a number to the end of the list with `append`. The new stack, shorter by one number, is returned in **4**.

Add more functions:

- multiply two numbers
- print the stack (does not modify the stack)
- print the last value from the stack 
- using the `math` module add several more mathematical operations
- print some help information (does not modify the stack)
- "quit" adds `None` to the stack

Refer to the functions from a dictionary whose keys are python strings - the names of the functions.
The values in the dictionaries are the functions themselves.

Create a `while` loop that checks if `None` is in the stack using `in`, if it's in the stack - exit.
In the loop ask the user to enter the command name, run the appropriate command from the dictionary
to modify the stack. If the command is not in the dictionary keys, assume that the user entered
a floating point number and append it to the stack.

<center>
**B**
</center>

<center>
(1 points)
</center>

Make the code from **A** a little more bullet proof:

- make sure that the functions from **A** check if there are enough elements on the stack
- make sure that when the user enters a number to push to the stack - it is a properly formatted floating
  point number (tip: use `try` and `except`, we will discuss this during class)

<center>
**C**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Add another module `extra.py` with additional functions. Modify **A** to look inside this module
for additional functions (tip: use the `__dict__` attribute, we will discuss this during class).

<center>
**D**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Implement a simple class that iterates over the [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence).
The constructor takes one argument - the number of Fibonacci numbers to iterate over. We will discuss
the details during class.

*...dictionaries, ciphers, and more on files...*
</center>

<center>
**A**
</center>

<center>
(2 points + 1 point)
</center>

Implement two functions.
The first one encodes the plaintext ... `plaintext` (string of characters):
```python
def encode(key , plaintext):
    # ...
    # return ciphertext
```
and the second one decodes the ciphertext ... `ciphertext` (string of characters):
```python
def decode(key , ciphertext):
    # ...
    # return plaintext
```
Both functions take a string of characters, `key`, as the first argument.

Use any cipher you like. We will discuss options during class. The extra point is for interesting solutions.

<center>
**B**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Rewrite the functions from **A**.
Implement `encoder` and `decoder` so that they can be used:
```python
myEncoder = encoder("secret_key")
myDecoder = decoder("secret_key")

plaintext = "this is the plaintext"
ciphertext = myEncoder(plaintext)

print(myDecoder(ciphertext) == plaintext) # true
```

Use two different methods:

- `encoder` and `decoder` are functions that return functions
- `myEncoder` and `myDecoder` are objects of a class that has a `__call__` method

<center>
**C**
</center>

<center>
(3 points + 1 point)
</center>

Using the [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) library implement a simple note taking
application. The application has only one positional argument:

- `password` will be used as the key to encrypt and decrypt messages

and the following optional arguments:

- `--keywords` or `-k` will be used to add single keywords, this option can be used multiple times
- `--print` or `-p` will print all notes
- `--printany` or `-a` will print only those notes that contain any of the keywords
- `--printall` or `-o` will print only those notes that contain all of the keywords
- `--new` or `-n` will ask the user for the text of a new note with the appropriate keywords
- `--delete` or `-d` will delete a note with a given number

In your implementation:

- store the text of the note in encrypted form, use the functions from the previous exercises
- store the notes in a single file located in the same directory as the script (we will discuss this during class)
- use the `json` module to save the updated list of notes in the same directory as the script
- use a `set` to store the keywords
- apart from the keywords assign the creation date (using `datetime`) to each note and a unique number
- use formatted string literals when printing a note, make sure that the date, number, keywords, and
  note text are displayed in a clear way
- make sure that all the arguments have help information available (using `argparse`)
- make sure that the program has a description information available (using `argparse`)

Extra point: replace the positional argument `password` with an appropriate function from the `getpass` modle. 
Is this safer? Why?

DISCLAMER: This note taking application is only as safe as our implmentation makes it. Use at your own risk!

Next time we will be talking about the `numpy` module.
In preparation please write a script that multiplies two $1024 \times 1024$ matrices. Use python lists and list comprehensions to implement 
the matrices. Measure how much time the script takes to execute.
