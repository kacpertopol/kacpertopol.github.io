It's $3$ o'clock in the morning and you need to prepare some formula to feed your newborn baby. The instructions on the package are
very specific: prepare a certain amount of water at a given temperature, add the correct amount of formula, mix 
and cool everything down before serving. In order to keep the baby safe from infections, 
all the water that you use needs to be pre-boiled. Here is your setup:

1. You prepared a container of pre-boiled water
   cooled down to the temperature $T_{\text{cool}}$. 
2. You prepared an empty, sterile feeding bottle.
3. You have an electric kettle and measured that when the water comes out of the spout it has temperature
   $T_{\text{hot}}$ (it's slightly cooler then $100^{\circ}C$).
4. You need to prepare $V$ milliliters (or any other unit of volume) water at temperature $T$ to mix
   up the formula for your little one. You do this by first pouring $V_{\text{cool}}$ milliliters (or any other unit of volume)
   of the cooler water into the bottle and then filling the bottle up to $V$ with the hot water from the kettle. How much cool water 
   should you use?

The mathematics of this problem is very simple, see the **APPENDIX**.
To make things more convenient implement the python function:
```python
def calculateVcool(Tcool , Thot , V , T):
    #...
    return Vcool
```
that returns the volume of the cooler water $V_{\text{cool}}$ you need to pour into the bottle before pouring the remainder
of the water
from the kettle. This volume is calculated in such a way that when mixed the water has temperature $T$. 

Tip: If you find yourself in this scenario a infrared thermometer is a fantastic tool.

Turn the ``V``, ``T``, and ``Thot`` arguments of function ``calculateVcool`` from exercise **A** into 
optional arguments with realistic default values for a $3$
month old baby.

Write a python script that asks the user to input the arguments of ``calculateVcool`` from **A**,
runs the function and prints the result.

Nobody has time to fiddle around with their laptop at $3$ o'clock in the morning. Get the script from **C**
to run on your phone (at your own risk :-) ).

Your significant other (SO) has the early morning shift with the baby and asked you to prepare a thermos
with pre-boiled water. You have determined the temperature coefficient of the thermos (the mathematics
of this is very simple, see the **APPENDIX**) and need to decide on the temperature of the water 
in the thermos so that in a couple of hours, when your SO needs to prepare the formula, the temperature
of the water in the thermos is appropriate.

To help with this implement the python function:
```python
def calculateTemperature(Tfinal , time , Troom , k , 
        search = (0.0 , 100.0 , 1000)):
    #...
    return T
```    
where ``Tfinal`` is the desired temperature of the water after time ``time``, ``Troom`` is the 
ambient room temperature and ``k`` is the temperature coefficient. The final optional argument 
``search`` determines the parameters
of a numerical simulation that will solve the problem.
The returned value ``T`` is the desired temperature
of water in the thermos.

Use a simple numerical simulation to solve the problem.
In this simulation scan initial water temperature 
candidates in the range ``search[0]`` $\ldots$ 
``search[1]``. The range is divided into ``search[2]`` temperature values. 
For each temperature candidate, the final temperature after time ``time``
is calculated (see **APPENDIX**). Finally, out of all the temperature
candidates, the one whose final temperature is closest to the desired ``Tfinal``
is returned as ``T``. In your implementation please use:

- a list comprehension,
- tuple unpacking,
- the functions \verb|min| and \verb|index|.

Tip: The exponent is available in the ``math`` library. There is no need to install anything, it comes 
built in. Simply use ``from math import exp``

When mixing water to arrive at a given temperature, approximately (the notation is the same as in the exercises):
$$
	V_{\text{cool}} = V \frac{T_{\text{hot}} - T}{T_{\text{hot}} - T_{\text{cool}}}
$$
Does it matter if we use $^{\circ}C$ or $^{\circ}K$? Is the formula any different if you prefer to pour the
hot water first?

When water in a container is left in a room with ambient temperature $T_{\text{room}}$ it will gradually, 
over time change it's temperature to match the ambient temperature. This process can be approximately modeled
by the formula:
$$
	\tau(t) = T_{\text{room}} - (T_{\text{room}} - \tau(0)) e^{-t/k}
$$
where $\tau(0)$ is the initial temperature of water in the thermos and $\tau(t)$ is the temperature in the 
thermos after time $t$. The remaining notation is the same as in the exercises. Please note that 
a non-standard definition of the temperature coefficient $k$ is used. The value of this coefficient
can be worked out by measuring the temperature of the water in the thermos at two points in time 
and doing a little algebra.
Does it matter if we use $^{\circ}C$ or $^{\circ}K$? Is the formula any different if you prefer to pour the
hot water first?

Implement a function that takes an arbitrary number of arguments,
say floating point numbers,
and returns a dictionary containing:

- a list containing all the arguments
- the mean of the arguments
- the standard deviation of the arguments

Use this function in a script.

Implement a simple [text based game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game). The gameplay
and objective is completely up to you. 

Please base your implementation on the following function:
```python
def updateGameState(state)
    # ...
```
that updates the dictionary `state` in every iteration of the
main game loop:
```python
while(!state["finished"]):
    # ...    
```

At each iteration of the game loop print
the available moves / options available to the player and use the `input`
function to decide on how to proceed with the game play. Use `if`, `else`, and `elif`
statements to decide how the game `state` will evolve. When the game is finished, change
the value of `"finished"` in `state` to `True`. This will cause the main loop of the
game to terminate.

Add some elegant [ASCI art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) to your game.
To do this please import the `sys` module and use the `sys.stdout.write` method
to implement the function:
```python
def showGameState(state):
    # ...
```
that will print a beautiful graphical representation of the game state to "standard output".
Add this function to the main game loop.
Please assume that we are working in a terminal that is $80$ characters wide and $40$ characters tall.

Tips:

- use two nested `for` loops to sweep over all the $80 \times 40$ "pixel" display we use in the game
- use `if` and / or a dictionary to decide what character to put in each "pixel"
- the new line character is `\n`
- this does not have to be very complicated, drawing a map with the location of the player is great but 
  printing some basic information about the game statistics is 
  also fine

Implement a "smart" function:
```python
def smartFunction(a , b):
    # ...
    return c
```
that returns the result `c = a + b`. Since this
operation is very laborious and time consuming, the function memorizes previous arguments
`a`, `b` that were passed to it, it also memorizes the result. This is all in the hope that when 
we pass those arguments to the function again it won't have to do all that work, it'll 
just recall the result.

In order to achieve this introduce a global variable `smartFunctionMemory` that will contain a dictionary.
The keys in this dictionary are related to the arguments `a`, `b`, and the values are related to the
results `c`.

What types of arguments can we pass into `smartFunction`?

Implement the function:
```python
def readState(path)
    # ...
    return state
```
that reads the state from a file located at path `path`. The contents of this file
is processed to obtain the saved state of a previous game. 

Implement the function:
```python
def writeState(state , path)
    # ...
```
that writes the game state to a file located at path `path`.

Add `readState` before the start of the game loop and `writeState` after the loop to allow the user
to save the game progress.

Tip: Don't worry we'll discuss the details during class :-)
