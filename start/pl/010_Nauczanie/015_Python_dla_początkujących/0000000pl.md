It's $3$ o'clock in the morning and you need to prepare some formula to feed your newborn baby. The instructions on the package are
very specific: prepare a certain amount of water at a given temperature, add the correct amount of formula, mix 
and cool everything down before serving. In order to keep the baby safe from infections, 
all the water that you use needs to be pre-boiled. Here is your setup:

1. You prepared a container of pre-boiled water
   cooled down to the temperature $T_{\text{cool}}$. 
2. You prepared an empty, sterile feeding bottle.
3. You have an electric kettle and measured that when the water comes out of the spout it has temperature
   $T_{\text{hot}}$ (it's slightly cooler then $100^{\circ}C$).
4. You need to prepare $V$ milliliters (or any other unit of volume) water at temperature $T$ to mix
   up the formula for your little one. You do this by first pouring $V_{\text{cool}}$ milliliters (or any other unit of volume)
   of the cooler water into the bottle and then filling the bottle up to $V$ with the hot water from the kettle. How much cool water 
   should you use?

The mathematics of this problem is very simple, see the **APPENDIX**.
To make things more convenient implement the python function:
```python
def calculateVcool(Tcool , Thot , V , T):
    #...
    return Vcool
```
that returns the volume of the cooler water $V_{\text{cool}}$ you need to pour into the bottle before pouring the remainder
of the water
from the kettle. This volume is calculated in such a way that when mixed the water has temperature $T$. 

Tip: If you find yourself in this scenario a infrared thermometer is a fantastic tool.

Turn the ``V``, ``T``, and ``Thot`` arguments of function ``calculateVcool`` from exercise **A** into 
optional arguments with realistic default values for a $3$
month old baby. 

<center>
**C**
</center>

Write a python script that asks the user to input the arguments of ``calculateVcool`` from **A**,
runs the function and prints the result.

Your significant other (SO) has the early morning shift with the baby and asked you to prepare a thermos
with pre-boiled water. You have determined the temperature coefficient of the thermos (the mathematics
of this is very simple, see the **APPENDIX**) and need to decide on the temperature of the water 
in the thermos so that in a couple of hours, when your SO needs to prepare the formula, the temperature
of the water in the thermos is appropriate.

To help with this implement the python function:
```python
def calculateTemperature(Tfinal , time , Troom , k , 
        search = (0.0 , 100.0 , 1000)):
    #...
    return T
```    
where ``Tfinal`` is the desired temperature of the water after time ``time``, ``Troom`` is the 
ambient room temperature and ``k`` is the temperature coefficient. The final optional argument 
``search`` determines the parameters
of a numerical simulation that will solve the problem.
The returned value ``T`` is the desired temperature
of water in the thermos.

Use a simple numerical simulation to solve the problem.
In this simulation scan initial water temperature 
candidates in the range ``search[0]`` $\ldots$ 
``search[1]``. The range is divided into ``search[2]`` temperature values. 
For each temperature candidate, the final temperature after time ``time``
is calculated (see **APPENDIX**). Finally, out of all the temperature
candidates, the one whose final temperature is closest to the desired ``Tfinal``
is returned as ``T``. In your implementation please use:

- a list comprehension,
- tuple unpacking,
- the functions \verb|min| and \verb|index|.

Tip: The exponent is available in the ``math`` library. There is no need to install anything, it comes 
built in. Simply use ``from math import exp``

<center>
**APPENDIX**
</center>

When mixing water to arrive at a given temperature, approximately (the notation is the same as in the exercises):
$$
	V_{\text{cool}} = V \frac{T_{\text{hot}} - T}{T_{\text{hot}} - T_{\text{cool}}}
$$
Does it matter if we use $^{\circ}C$ or $^{\circ}K$? Is the formula any different if you prefer to pour the
hot water first?

When water in a container is left in a room with ambient temperature $T_{\text{room}}$ it will gradually, 
over time change it's temperature to match the ambient temperature. This process can be approximately modeled
by the formula:
$$
	\tau(t) = T_{\text{room}} - (T_{\text{room}} - \tau(0)) e^{-t/k}
$$
where $\tau(0)$ is the initial temperature of water in the thermos and $\tau(t)$ is the temperature in the 
thermos after time $t$. The remaining notation is the same as in the exercises. Please note that 
a non-standard definition of the temperature coefficient $k$ is used. The value of this coefficient
can be worked out by measuring the temperature of the water in the thermos at two points in time 
and doing a little algebra.
Does it matter if we use $^{\circ}C$ or $^{\circ}K$? Is the formula any different if you prefer to pour the
hot water first?

*...to is or not to is, dictionaries, loops, flow control, modules and objects...*
</center>

<center>
**A**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Implement a function that takes an arbitrary number of arguments,
say floating point numbers,
and returns a dictionary containing:

- a list containing all the arguments
- the mean of the arguments
- the standard deviation of the arguments

Use this function in a script.

<center>
**B**
</center>

<center>
(3 points)
</center>

Implement a simple [text based game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game). The gameplay
and objective is completely up to you. 

Please base your implementation on the following function:
```python
def updateGameState(state)
    # ...
```
that updates the dictionary `state` in every iteration of the
main game loop:
```python
while(!state["finished"]):
    # ...    
```

At each iteration of the game loop print
the available moves / options available to the player and use the `input`
function to decide on how to proceed with the game play. Use `if`, `else`, and `elif`
statements to decide how the game `state` will evolve. When the game is finished, change
the value of `"finished"` in `state` to `True`. This will cause the main loop of the
game to terminate.

<center>
**C**
</center>

<center>
(3 points)
</center>

Add some elegant [ASCI art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) to your game.
To do this please import the `sys` module and use the `sys.stdout.write` method
to implement the function:
```python
def showGameState(state):
    # ...
```
that will print a beautiful graphical representation of the game state to "standard output".
Add this function to the main game loop.
Please assume that we are working in a terminal that is $80$ characters wide and $40$ characters tall.

Tips:

- use two nested `for` loops to sweep over all the $80 \times 40$ "pixel" display we use in the game
- use `if` and / or a dictionary to decide what character to put in each "pixel"
- the new line character is `\n`
- this does not have to be very complicated, drawing a map with the location of the player is great but 
  printing some basic information about the game statistics is 
  also fine

<center>
**D**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Implement a "smart" function:
```python
def smartFunction(a , b):
    # ...
    return c
```
that returns the result `c = a + b`. Since this
operation is very laborious and time consuming, the function memorizes previous arguments
`a`, `b` that were passed to it, it also memorizes the result. This is all in the hope that when 
we pass those arguments to the function again it won't have to do all that work, it'll 
just recall the result.

In order to achieve this introduce a global variable `smartFunctionMemory` that will contain a dictionary.
The keys in this dictionary are related to the arguments `a`, `b`, and the values are related to the
results `c`.

What types of arguments can we pass into `smartFunction`?

<center>
**E**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Implement the function:
```python
def readState(path)
    # ...
    return state
```
that reads the state from a file located at path `path`. The contents of this file
is processed to obtain the saved state of a previous game. 

Implement the function:
```python
def writeState(state , path)
    # ...
```
that writes the game state to a file located at path `path`.

Add `readState` before the start of the game loop and `writeState` after the loop to allow the user
to save the game progress.

Tip: Don't worry we'll discuss the details during class :-)

Replace the repeated `if`, `elif`, `else` statements from your game in **Set 2** with `match`.
If these statements don't appear in the game, please add some.

<center>
**B**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

End your scripts from **Set 1** with an infinite `while` loop instead of a call similar to `input("Hit enter to exit.")`.
Please use `pass` in the infinite loop. 

Import the `time` module and use the `time.time()` function to measure the time the program spends in the loop.
If this time exceeds $10$ seconds, ask the user if the program should exit. If the program is supposed to wait
reset the timer and run the loop for another $10$ seconds.

Tip: use `continue`, and `break`.

**C**
</center>

<center>

</center>

Using the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) please investigate the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map).

Create a function that calculates the logistic map and draw the map using the `matplotlib` library, we will discuss how this library works during class. 
Make sure the notebook
has a detailed description of your approach, use [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

<center>
**D**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Re-implement the function from **C** to accept a keyword argument `drawFunction`. If the value of this keyword
argument is not the default `None` then `drawFunction` points to a function that draws the data and a plot of the 
logistic map is produced automatically.

Test if this works using a `lambda` expression.

Can you use `is` to check if `drawFunction` has the default value?

Implement a [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) calculator. 
Base your program on a stack implemented as a python `list`. All operations of the calculator 
take the stack, modify it and return the modified stack. For example adding two numbers:

```python
def add(stack):
    x = stack.pop()      # 1
    y = stack.pop()      # 2
    stack.append(x + y)  # 3
    return stack         # 4
```

At **1** a number is popped from the end of the list with `pop` resulting in a shorter stack. 
At **2** another number is popped from the stack. Finally in **3** the stack is modified by adding
a number to the end of the list with `append`. The new stack, shorter by one number, is returned in **4**.

Add more functions:

- multiply two numbers
- print the stack (does not modify the stack)
- print the last value from the stack 
- using the `math` module add several more mathematical operations
- print some help information (does not modify the stack)
- "quit" adds `None` to the stack

Refer to the functions from a dictionary whose keys are python strings - the names of the functions.
The values in the dictionaries are the functions themselves.

Create a `while` loop that checks if `None` is in the stack using `in`, if it's in the stack - exit.
In the loop ask the user to enter the command name, run the appropriate command from the dictionary
to modify the stack. If the command is not in the dictionary keys, assume that the user entered
a floating point number and append it to the stack.

<center>
**B**
</center>

<center>
(1 points)
</center>

Make the code from **A** a little more bullet proof:

- make sure that the functions from **A** check if there are enough elements on the stack
- make sure that when the user enters a number to push to the stack - it is a properly formatted floating
  point number (tip: use `try` and `except`, we will discuss this during class)

<center>
**C**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Add another module `extra.py` with additional functions. Modify **A** to look inside this module
for additional functions (tip: use the `__dict__` attribute, we will discuss this during class).

<center>
**D**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Implement a simple class that iterates over the [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence).
The constructor takes one argument - the number of Fibonacci numbers to iterate over. We will discuss
the details during class.

(2 points + 1 point)
</center>

Implement two functions.
The first one encodes the plaintext ... `plaintext` (string of characters):
```python
def encode(key , plaintext):
    # ...
    # return ciphertext
```
and the second one decodes the ciphertext ... `ciphertext` (string of characters):
```python
def decode(key , ciphertext):
    # ...
    # return plaintext
```
Both functions take a string of characters, `key`, as the first argument.

Use any cipher you like. We will discuss options during class. The extra point is for interesting solutions.

<center>
**B**
</center>

<center>
(2 points)
</center>

Rewrite the functions from **A**.
Implement `encoder` and `decoder` so that they can be used:
```python
myEncoder = encoder("secret_key")
myDecoder = decoder("secret_key")

plaintext = "this is the plaintext"
ciphertext = myEncoder(plaintext)

print(myDecoder(ciphertext) == plaintext) # true
```

Use two different methods:

- `encoder` and `decoder` are functions that return functions
- `myEncoder` and `myDecoder` are objects of a class that has a `__call__` method

Using the [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) library implement a simple note taking
application. The application has only one positional argument:

- `password` will be used as the key to encrypt and decrypt messages

and the following optional arguments:

- `--keywords` or `-k` will be used to add single keywords, this option can be used multiple times
- `--print` or `-p` will print all notes
- `--printany` or `-a` will print only those notes that contain any of the keywords
- `--printall` or `-o` will print only those notes that contain all of the keywords
- `--new` or `-n` will ask the user for the text of a new note with the appropriate keywords
- `--delete` or `-d` will delete a note with a given number

In your implementation:

- store the text of the note in encrypted form, use the functions from the previous exercises for encrypting and decrypting, 
  and `password` as the key
- use the `json` module to store the notes in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format
- store the notes in a single file located in the same directory as the script (we will discuss this during class)
- use a `set` to store the keywords
- apart from the keywords assign the creation date (using `datetime`) to each note and a unique number
- use formatted string literals when printing a note, make sure that the date, number, keywords, and
  note text are displayed in a clear way
- make sure that all the arguments have help information available (using `argparse`)
- make sure that the program has a description information available (using `argparse`)

Extra point: replace the positional argument `password` with an appropriate function from the `getpass` modle. 
Is this safer? Why?

DISCLAMER: This note taking application is only as safe as our implmentation makes it. Use at your own risk!

Using the `numpy` library please implement 
[the game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
with periodic boundary conditions (the left half of the grid is glued to the right, the 
top part of the grid is glued to the bottom ... essentially creating a torus).
The implementation should be a single script.
The grid of cells is represented by a `numpy` array with an integer `dtype`. 
When implementing a single iteration of the game, please stick to the `numpy` library
as strictly as possible to boost performance. Test the performance using large
grids (1920 by 1080 and larger). 

Tip: Use the `numpy.roll` function to obtain the state of neighbouring cells. Visualization
can be achieved using the `matplotlib.pyplot` library functions,
[`imshow`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html) or
[`matshow`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.matshow.html) function.
We will cover the basic usage of `matplotlib` during class.

<center>

Extend **A** to continuous values: the state of the cell can be dead (0), alive (1)
or anything in between. There are many sensible ways of doing this. One way is "smooth life", see
the links:

- [online simulation](https://smooth-life.netlify.app/)
- [pre-print](http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1567)

Tip: The function 
[`convolve2d`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.convolve2d.html) 
from the `scipy` might be helpful. It works with `numpy` arrays.
Visualization
can be achieved using the `matplotlib.pyplot` library functions,
[`imshow`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html) or
[`matshow`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.matshow.html) function.

Add a simple interactive command line interface to **A** or **B**. The program should
give the user at least the following options:

- save state of the game (the grid of cells) into a file with specified path
- load state of the game (the grid of cells) from a file with specified path
- run a specified amount of iterations
- quit

Be persistent, if the user types an incorrect value prompt him / her again. To do this use `try`,
`except`.

... Obtaining the number of neighbours for the basic 
[game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) ...

Let's assume that we start from random configuration of $4 \times 4$ cells:

```python
import numpy as np                                        # 1
s = 4                                                     # 2
state = np.random.randint(0 , high = 2 , size = (s , s))  # 3
print(state)                                              # 4
```

In **1** we import the `numpy` library, in **2** we set the size of the matrix
containing cell states, in **3** we draw a random distribution of cells (0 meaning a dead cell
1 meaning a live cell, the integers
are drawn from a uniform distribution between $0$ and `high - 1` $= 1$). Finally **4**
prints our result:

```
[[0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 1 0]
 [1 1 0 1]
 [0 1 0 1]]
```
To get a table whose values at a specific row and column correspond the state if the eight
neighbors (Up, Down , Right , Left , UpRight , DownLeft , UpLeft, DownRight) we first `roll`
the arrays to obtain:

```python
U = np.roll(state , 1 , axis = 0)
D = np.roll(state , -1 , axis = 0)
R = np.roll(state , -1 , axis = 1)
L = np.roll(state , 1 , axis = 1)
UR = np.roll(np.roll(state , 1 , axis = 0) , -1 , axis = 1)
DL = np.roll(np.roll(state , -1 , axis = 0) , 1 , axis = 1)
UL = np.roll(np.roll(state , 1 , axis = 0) , 1 , axis = 1)
DR = np.roll(np.roll(state , -1 , axis = 0) , -1 , axis = 1)
```
and then sum:

```python
neighbors = U + D + R + L + UR + DL + UL + DR
print(neighbors)
```
as a result, each cell has the following number of neighbors:
```
[[3 3 4 2]
 [4 3 3 3]
 [5 4 6 3]
 [5 2 4 2]]
 ```
 This should be correct if we assume periodic boundaries
 (the left edge is glued to the right edge and the top edge is glued to the
 bottom edge).

 The next bit is tricky. There are many ways of implementing a single iteration of the game.
 Since we are looking to eliminate regular python loops to increase the speed of our program
 have a look at the following functions `np.ones`, `np.zeros`, `np.where`, `np.logical_and`,
 `np.logical_or` and then have a close look the following code:

 ```python
 allAlive = np.ones((s , s) , dtype = np.int64)
 allDead = np.zeros((s , s) , dtype = np.int64)
 np.where(np.logical_and(state == 0 , neighbors == 3) , allAlive , state)
 ```

This can be easily extended to include the whole set of rules of the game. 
Remember stick to `numpy` for performance.

... The same thing but this time with convolutions ...

Let's import the `convolve2d` function from the `scipy.signal` library.
Note that we are not importing the whole package nut just one function:

```python
from scipy.signal import convolve2d
```

Next let's try this:

```python
k = np.array([[1 , 1 , 1] , [1 , 0 , 1] , [1 , 1 , 1]])
neighborsWithConvolve2D = convolve2d(state , k , mode = "same" , boundary="wrap")
print(neighborsWithConvolve2D)
```

The result should be the same as `neighbors`:

```
[[3 3 4 2]
 [4 3 3 3]
 [5 4 6 3]
 [5 2 4 2]]
```

The result is the same but the method is more general.
We can look at a wider neighborhood of a cell by
modifying `k`.

... The user input is all wrong ...

Tip: Saving a `numpy` array can be obtained by running `np.save` (or `numpy.save` if we used just `import numpy`).
Loading a `numpy` array can be obtained by running `np.load`. Both these functions raise exceptions if they get a
bad file path. This means that we can use them inside `try:` and `except:` blocks. The function `int` also
raised exceptions when it's string argument is not a correctly formatted integer.

Define a class whose objects hold a numerical value. At minimum, the class should
have the following methods apart from the constructor:

- `__add__`, `__sub__` "magic" method to add and subtract objects of this class using the `+` and `-` operators
- `__mul__`, `__truediv__` "magic" methods to multiply and divide objects of this class using the `*` and `/` operators 
- `__neg__` to get the negative number using the `-` operator
- `__str__`, `__repr__` to return the string representation of the number in objects of this class

In addition to performing numerical operations `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__truediv__`, and `__neg__`
should appropriately increase the four class counters that determine how many additions, multiplications, divisions and 
negations were executed.
Add the following class methods:

- `resetCounters` resets counters that count the number of multiplications, additions, divisions and negations
- `getCounters` returns a tuple with the counters of multiplications, additions, divisions and negations

Use this class to determine the computational complexity of matrix multiplication and calculating 
the application of a matrix to a vector.

In an era before electronic calculators, logarithms were king. 
Two usefull properties of the logarithm function:
$$
\log{a b} = \log{a} + \log{b}
$$
$$
\log{a / b} = \log{a} - \log{b}
$$
make it possible to change multiplication and division into 
addition and subtraction which require much less effort.
This observation lies at the heart two interesting old calculating methods:
[the slide rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule), and
[tables of logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_table#Tables_of_logarithms).
We will be focusing on the latter.

Please read [this section](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#fancier-output-formatting)
on fancier string formatting and create a string containing a table of logarithms: 

```
-------------------
| x     |  Log(x) |
-------------------
| 1.00  |  0.0000 |
| 1.01  |  0.0043 |
| 1.02  |  0.0086 |
...
| 1.20  |  0.0792 |
...
| 2.00  |  0.3010 |
...
| 6.00  |  0.7782 |
...
| 10.0  |  1.0000 |
-------------------

```
the first column has numbers going from $1$ to $10$ (the step size is up to you). The second columns 
is a base $10$ logarithm of the corresponding number in the first column.

How can we use this table in practice. Let's say we want to multiply $2$ by $6$:
$$
\log_{10}{2 \times 6} = \log_{10}{2} + \log_{10}{6} \approx 0.3010 + 0.7782 = 1.0792 = \log_{10}{x}
$$
where $x$ is our approximate result ($\approx 12$). 
We can approximate the logarithms by looking at our table and addition is easy enough
(a person equipped with only a book of logarithm tables and an abacus is a dangerous
calculating machine).
There is a problem though, if we look at the second column the value $1.0792$ is out of range, how do we solve this?
Simple, just subtract $1$ (or divide by $10$ depending on how you look at it):
$$
\log_{10}(x / 10) = \log_{10}{x} - \log_{10}{10} = 1.0792 - 1.0 = 0.0792
$$
The value $0.0792$ is no longer out of range in the second column and corresponds to ... $1.20$ which is 
our apporximate (we are doing approximations here left and right, let's not forget about this)
result divided by $10$. So to summarize logarithm tables, plus some extra tricks like dividing by ten 
or subtracting one, are a powerful calculating tool.

Save your table into a text file. Make sure that:

- the columns have consistent width
  - one option is to round the numbers to a set precision
  - other options are available [in the tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#fancier-output-formatting)
- the table has a header 
- the extra points is for using [block elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements) instead 
  of `|` and `+` in drawing the frame of the table

Hint: logarithms are available in the `math` library. To calculate the base $10$ logarithm of $2.0$ 
you can use `math.log(2.0 , 10)`.

Change the formatting of your logarithm table to use 
[$\LaTeX$ syntax for tables](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tables).
Make the table larger and split it into multiple separate tables.
Each page should contain a single table.
Add special values for $\pi$, $\e$ etc.
Can we add more columns to perform calculations with square roots and trigonometric functions?

Save the string with your table into a file with a `.tex` extension. Compile it with $\LaTeX$.

Write a simple calendar application. The calendar events are written to a text file
with the following style of syntax:

```
...
python for beginners @ 2025-01-10 16:00-18:30 
lunch @ 2025-01-11 12:00-13:00 
...
```

The application has a simple programming interface. Given a day:


```
$ python myCalendarAll.py 2025-01-11
```

it returns a list of events and for that day in a nicely formatted table with the hours
in a separate column.   

Use exceptions and exception chaining when reading the calendar file.
If there is a syntax error in the file - gracefully handle the situation.
Don't crash the program, provide the user with information about the error
(line number for example) so the problem could be fixed.

Tip: Use the `split` method for strings and, for now, `ValueError` exceptions.
Use the `argparse` library to create a command line interface.

- badly formatted date
- badly formatted time
- no date specified
- no time specified

Create a base class `CalendarEvent` with the following methods:

- `getDate` returns a string with the date for the time of the calendar event
- `getTime` returns a string with the time for the calendar event
- `getDescription` returns a string with the description of the calendar event
- `getRow` returns a elegantly formated string with information about the event

Next create three child classes:

- `EventWithTimeAndDate`
- `EventWithDateAndNoTime`
- `EventWithTimeAndNoDate`

That hande the situations described by their name.
