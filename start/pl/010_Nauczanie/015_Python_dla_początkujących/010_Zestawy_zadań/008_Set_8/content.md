Addition and subtraction require far fewer operations then multiplication
and division.
This observation lies at the heart two interesting old calculating methods:

- [the slide rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule)
- [tables of logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_table#Tables_of_logarithms)

Both of these methods use the very usefull property of logarithms:

$$
\log{a b} = \log{a} + \log{b}
$$

$$
\log{a / b} = \log{a} - \log{b}
$$

These properties allow us to turn multiplication or division (computationally expensive operations)
into addition or subtraction (computationally inexpensive operations)! A person equipped with 
a simple abbacus and a table of logarithms can carry out some very complex computations.

Please create a file with a table of logarithms. TODO
